He was molested when he was still young which caused him to engage into homosexual acts. Since his boss attends our Sunday Service, she invited him to attend our Youth Service in Antipolo last year and gave his life to Jesus but decided to go through one2one just last January 2017. One of the highlights of his discipleship is when he said that he no longer wanted to go back. It was clear to him that homosexuality is sin and that Jesus is his Lord and Savior. He also attended our God Test Training last March and started sharing the Gospel. Just last week (April 30) he went through water baptism in Victory Weekend. He publicly declared that he is a follower of Jesus Christ. He is excited to attended our Foundations Class this week. One of his desires to share his testimony to those who are struggling with the same struggles that he had and preach the Gospel to them.\",\"studentDiscipleshipClassification\":\"Other\",\"studentDiscipleshipOtherTitle\":\"\",\"studentDiscipleshipStory\":\"n/a\",\"leadershipDevelopmentClassification\":\"Other\",\"leadershipDevelopmentOtherTitle\":\"\",\"leadershipDevelopmentStory\":\"n/a\",\"createdBy\":\"3\",\"createdDate\":\"2017-06-17 14:44:21\",\"lastModDate\":\"2017-06-17 14:44:21\"},{\"id\":\"2\",\"monthReport\":\"February\",\"monthYear\":\"2017\",\"youthServiceAttendance\":\"344\",\"tnoEnvelope\":\"172\",\"campusOutreachStoryClassification\":\"Salvation\",\"campusOutreachStoryOtherTitle\":\"\",\"campusOutreachStory\":\"Our ENC Antipolo team went to San Isidro National High School during their dismissal to invite them to our youth service.
